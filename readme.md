Agent Based Model + Probabilistic Programming + Deep Learning

Can we bind these powerful tools together?

---

This project started with a general purpose to understand how to develop an infectious disease model to help reasoning disease.

In the study, I found ABM with probabilistic programming was a powerful tool to describe the trending of infectious diseases.

But sophisticated models are way too complicated to develop. It often took several years to be useful.

Based on Tensorflow and/or Pytorch
